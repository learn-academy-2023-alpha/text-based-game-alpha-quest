# Pseudo for Game Logic



Questions:

Person 1: What was your teamâ€™s approach to solving this problem?  Did the initial approach work out in the end?
Whiteboarding
brainstorming 
Initial skeleton of code
getting really secure on what we need to actually get in the code
once we all knew what needed to be done, we could split an all code at the same time

'compare a string literal' error 

Person 2: What was the hardest thing about this project?  What is the biggest take away?
On our initial attempt at the game logic, we quickly realized that we needed a way to reduce the amount of 'pathways' a user could go down. By having the method 'restart' itself upon the end of a pathway, we were able to reduce the total number of conditional statements by a massive amount


Person 3 (if applicable):  
How did you manage the workflow in a group of three?
When we initially started the challenge Mike was driving, Aaron was mostly navigating and I was researching as we were working. Each of us worked to build the initial template that we used to complete the rest of the quests. Once we had created the template we then broke off separately, but still in the call and built our own individual quests. After we completed our individual quests we then compiled them onto Aarons vs code and edited the quests together by changing names, scenarios, etc.
